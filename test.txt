A beautiful Morning
You're sitting on top of the world, you look around and all you can see are blue skies and sunshine. Those days don't come around all the time but when they do you take a step back and realize how great life is. I myself have had a quiet a few days like that and let me tell you I wished they never ended. And though the 24 hour time span we refer to as a day maybe over it is a mere drop in the ocean of time we have in our lives and enjoying every minute is the only way to live. There will always be good days and bad days, however the extraordinary days are those who live in infamy through the stories of the old and have been.
             About a year ago I was living in Orlando, Florida and I was around 17 years old, and it was summer. I had woken up to a beautiful cloud free Floridian day. I was bored and had nothing to do, no job, no responsibilities, nothing. It started to be a chill day till around noon; so my friend Chris Lane, or C-Lane and I decided to go swimming. Well we felt like being rebels so we drove down to the Hard Rock Hotel at Universal studios and snuck into their amazing pool. We swam and hit on chicks for a solid hour or two. I then received a phone call from my friend saying he had free tickets to go to a concert at the Hard Rock Live Concert Hall. The band was called Hoobastank and the show started at five o'clock. It was around two o'clock so we had plenty of time.
             We roll up to the concert and Hoobastank rocked the place wild in morning. There were mosh pits and people dancing around and going crazy all over the place. They played all of their hit songs and a few I haven't heard of. I gained a lot of respect for them and had a great time. The show came to an end around 8 o'clock. A free day at a nice hotel pool, and free tickets to a concert, I thought this day couldn't get any better. I soon learned that the night had just begun.
